The numerical system used to be 12. The Russians have arshin, the English have an inch.
10 is an Arabic numeral. If you count on the hour dial, then 12 sections will consist of 6 minutes - 48 minutes per hour, respectively 48 seconds per minute. Then the need for a leap year falls off, there will be no errors in the calculation of the year.
Who else has an offer for an inch?
